# Roadmap
## Usability & fixes
- ✅ Done: Implement the four buttons
- Fix every major bug
- Write docs to allow using Junior for developing external projects

## Programming on mobile
- Develop a file browser to allow the user to select attention files from mobile
- Create an app by wrapping the frontend
- Test it by developing at the local Playground and while commuting

## Auto-attention
- Propose an attention based on the requirements and task the user selected
- Embed every file in the project
- Store the embeddings in an (embedded) vector database

## Prompt herds
- Scan and transform (refactor) the codebase gradually

```


# Task

Improve the documentation!

&#34;Write docs to allow using Junior for developing external projects&#34; is also done.


# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files using 'EOF' to prevent substitution.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Do NOT write any text outside the script!
