# Task

Fix the following issue!

fileList should contain the flattened version of
- the data if the data is not an array
- The object that wraps the data if data is an array




## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function or signal*! eg.: in createGitRepo.js: export function createGitRepo ( ....
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs* and Tailwind, edit .jsx files accordingly!

Write concise, self-documenting and idiomatic ES6 code!

# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Avoid using sed. Always heredoc full files.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Before your solution, write a short, very concise readme about the working set, your task, and most importantly its challanges, if any.


EXAMPLE START
```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 9 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
cat > x.js << 'EOF'
[FULL content of the file]
EOF
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
EXAMPLE END

Before starting, check if you need more files or info to solve the task.

If the task is not clear:

EXAMPLE START
I need more information to solve the task. [Description of the missing info]
EXAMPLE END

Do not edit files not provided in the working set!
If you need more files:

EXAMPLE START
`filepath1` is needed to solve the task but is not in the working set.
EXAMPLE END

# Working set

src/frontend/service/fetchFileList.js:
```
import { getBaseUrl } from '../getBaseUrl';
import { setFileList } from '../model/fileList';
import flattenPaths from './helpers/flattenPaths';

async function fetchFileList() {
  const baseUrl = getBaseUrl();
  const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/files/list`);
  const data = await response.json();
  let fileList = [];

  // Handle data and update file list
  if (Array.isArray(data)) {
    fileList = flattenPaths({
      type: "dir",
      name: ".",
      children: data
    }, '');
  }

  // Call setFileList unconditionally with either processed or empty data
  setFileList(fileList);
}

export default fetchFileList;

```
