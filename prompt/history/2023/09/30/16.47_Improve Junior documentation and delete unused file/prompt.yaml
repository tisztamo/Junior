  Add more info:


  1. --ignore accepts a comma-separated list of paths to be ignored from the
  attention scan. List the defaults and describe how the different sources are
  merged.


  2. the --prompt flag is not used, remove from the docs and delete
  getPromptFlag.js


  3. -s and -d and their long variants are only used in the cli. Spearate them
  and add a note that the cli is not fully functional at the time.
