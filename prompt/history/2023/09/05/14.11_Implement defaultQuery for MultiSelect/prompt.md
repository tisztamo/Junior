# Working set

src/frontend/components/AttentionFileList.jsx:
```
import { createEffect } from 'solid-js';
import { fileList, setFileList } from '../model/fileList';
import fetchFileList from '../service/fetchFileList';
import MultiSelect from './MultiSelect/MultiSelect';
import getComparison from '../service/helpers/getComparison';
import flattenPaths from '../service/helpers/flattenPaths';

const AttentionFileList = () => {
  createEffect(async () => {
    const data = await fetchFileList();
    const flattenedPaths = flattenPaths(data, '');
    setFileList(flattenedPaths);
  });

  return (
    <div class="w-full">
      <MultiSelect availableItems={fileList()} selectedItems={[]} compare={getComparison()} itemCount={5} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default AttentionFileList;

```

src/frontend/model/requirements.js:
```
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js';

export const [requirements, setRequirements] = createSignal('');

```


# Task

Implement the following feature!

- Create a plan!
- Create new files when needed!

Requirements:

In the attention file list:
When the requirements model changes, generate a query from it by passing
to extraxtQuery in service/helpers/extraxtQuery.js, which:
- Splits the requirements to words at any non-word char
- Drops words that are less than 3 chars in length or found in the ignore list (a constant array)
- joins them with space

Pass it to multiselect as a new prop: defaultQuery



## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function or signal*!
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs* and Tailwind, edit .jsx files accordingly!

# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files using 'EOF' to prevent substitution.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Do NOT write any text outside the script!

EXAMPLE START

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 7 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
[Commands solving the task]
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```

EXAMPLE END

Before starting, check if you need more files to solve the task.
Do not edit any file not provided in the working set!
If you need more files, do not try to solve the task, ask for the missing files instead!

EXAMPLE START

`filepath1` is needed to solve the task but is not in the working set.
