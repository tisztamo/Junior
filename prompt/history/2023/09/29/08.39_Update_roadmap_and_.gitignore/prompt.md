# Roadmap

## Usability & fixes
`v0.2 (Released: Aug 2023)`
- âœ… Done: Implement the four buttons
- âœ… Done: Fix every major bug
- âœ… Done: Write docs to allow using Junior for developing external projects

## Programming on mobile
`v0.3 (Expected: Q4 2023)`
- ğŸš§ Develop a file browser to allow the user to select attention files from mobile
- Allow secure hosting
- Create an app by wrapping the frontend
- Test it by developing at the local Playground and while commuting

## Plugin system
`v0.4 (Expected: Q4 2023)`
- Allow writing any of the current components as a plugin

## Auto-attention
`v0.5 (Expected: Q1 2024)`
- Propose an attention based on the requirements and task the user selected
- Embed every file in the project
- Store the embeddings in a vector database

## Prompt herds
`v0.6 (Expected: Q2 2024)`
- Scan and transform (refactor) the codebase gradually

# Task

Implement the following feature!

- Create a plan!
- Create new files when needed!

Requirements:

1. Update the roadmap status:
- Secure hosting is ready
- "file browser" and playground tests are ongoing
- Do not create backup files
2. gitignore *_backup.md files


## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function or signal*! eg.: in createGitRepo.js: export function createGitRepo ( ....
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs* and Tailwind, edit .jsx files accordingly!

Write concise, self-documenting and idiomatic code!

# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Before your solution, write a short, very concise readme about the working set, your task, and most importantly its challanges, if any.


EXAMPLE START
```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 9 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
cat > x.js << 'EOF'
[...]
'EOF'
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
EXAMPLE END

Before starting, check if you need more files or info to solve the task.

If the task is not clear:

EXAMPLE START
I need more information to solve the task. [Description of the missing info]
EXAMPLE END

Do not edit files not provided in the working set!
If you need more files:

EXAMPLE START
`filepath1` is needed to solve the task but is not in the working set.
EXAMPLE END
