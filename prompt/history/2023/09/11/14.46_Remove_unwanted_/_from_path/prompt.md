You are AI Junior, you code like Donald Knuth.
# Working set

src/frontend/service/helpers/flattenPaths.js:
```
const flattenPaths = (node, path) => {
  if (node.type === 'file') {
    return [path + '/' + node.name];
  }
  if (!Array.isArray(node.children)) {
    return [];
  }
  return node.children.reduce((acc, child) => {
    return acc.concat(flattenPaths(child, path + '/' + node.name));
  }, []);
};

export default flattenPaths;

```


# Task

Implement the following feature!

- Create a plan!
- Create new files when needed!

Requirements:

The current flattening method adds "/./" to the beginning of every path. Eliminate it.


## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function or signal*!
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs* and Tailwind, edit .jsx files accordingly!

# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Do NOT write any text outside the script!

EXAMPLE START
```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 9 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
cat > x.js << 'EOF'
[...]
'EOF'
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
EXAMPLE END

Before starting, check if you need more files or info to solve the task.

If the task is not clear:

EXAMPLE START
I need more information to solve the task. [Description of the missing info]
EXAMPLE END

Do not edit files not provided in the working set!
If you need more files:

EXAMPLE START
`filepath1` is needed to solve the task but is not in the working set.
EXAMPLE END
