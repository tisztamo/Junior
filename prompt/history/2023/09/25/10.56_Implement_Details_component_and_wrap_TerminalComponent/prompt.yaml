  1. Create a "Details" component that

  - Puts its content in a html details tag

  - Accepts a function as a prop to generate the header, and calls it reactively

  - Saves its state in localStorage. The key is passed as prop. If no state is
  saved, use the default value from a prop, or "open" if no default is provided.

  2. Wrap the terminal in a Details component which is closed by default.
