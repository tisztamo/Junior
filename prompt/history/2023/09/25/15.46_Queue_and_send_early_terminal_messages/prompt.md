# Working set

./src/frontend/service/terminal/terminalConnection.js:
```
import { createWebSocket } from '../createWebSocket';

const socket = createWebSocket('/terminal');

const sendDataToTerminal = (data) => {
  if (socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
    socket.send(data);
  }
};

const setOnDataReceived = (callback) => {
  socket.onmessage = (event) => {
    callback(event.data);
  };
};

const closeConnection = () => {
  if (socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
    socket.close();
  }
};

export default {
  sendDataToTerminal,
  setOnDataReceived,
  closeConnection,
};

```

# Task

Implement the following feature!

- Create a plan!
- Create new files when needed!

Requirements:

Terminalconnection should queue and send early messages.


## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function or signal*! eg.: in createGitRepo.js: export function createGitRepo ( ....
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs* and Tailwind, edit .jsx files accordingly!

# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files.

OS: Debian


Installed tools: npm, jq


Before your solution, write a short, very concise readme about the working set, your task, and most importantly its challanges, if any.


EXAMPLE START
```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 9 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
cat > x.js << 'EOF'
[...]
'EOF'
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
EXAMPLE END

Before starting, check if you need more files or info to solve the task.

If the task is not clear:

EXAMPLE START
I need more information to solve the task. [Description of the missing info]
EXAMPLE END

Do not edit files not provided in the working set!
If you need more files:

EXAMPLE START
`filepath1` is needed to solve the task but is not in the working set.
EXAMPLE END
