You are AI Junior, you code like Donald Knuth.
# Working set

./docs/web.md:
```
# Web Interface

Junior's web interface was designed for use with ChatGPT Pro and doesn't require an API key.

## Architecture

The web interface is composed of two different servers: a frontend and a backend. The frontend server runs on port 5173, and the backend server runs on port 10101.

## Starting the Web Interface

Run the application with `npx junior-web` from your project or with `npm start` from Junior itself. A web browser window will automatically open at `http://localhost:5173`, which is where you can access the web interface.

## Workflow

The typical workflow begins with editing the `prompt.yaml` file in your code editor of choice (we recommend Visual Studio Code with the Junior plugin for an optimal experience). Once you're satisfied with your task setup, you proceed to the web interface for execution and monitoring.

## Usage

The web interface has a few interactive components:

![Web Interface](./screenshot.png)

- **Generate & Copy Prompt button (Blue)**: Click this to generate a task prompt based on your `prompt.yaml` file and copy it to your clipboard. The copied prompt should be pasted to ChatGPT 4 or similar for execution.

- **Paste & Execute Change button (Orange)**: Paste the response from the AI model (a shell script) into the input field and click this button to execute the changes.

- **Roll Back to Last Commit button (Red)**: If you made a mistake or aren't happy with the changes, click this button to revert to the last commit. Please note, the rollback operation preserves the `prompt.yaml` file, but drops every change since the last commit, including new files created in the meantime, even if they were not created by Junior.

- **Terminal**: Displays the output of your command execution. It's a simple console that shows the progress of the task.

For a more detailed guide on using the web interface, refer to our video tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/W_iwry8uT7E).

Remember, you can always refer to your `prompt.yaml` file to modify the task details or attention mechanism.

Happy developing with your AI contributor!

# Task

Implement the following feature!

- Create a plan!
- Create new files when needed!

Requirements:

Change the frontend port to 5864.
After the rollback, write about the green commit button which commits to git.


## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function or signal*! eg.: in createGitRepo.js: export function createGitRepo ( ....
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs* and Tailwind, edit .jsx files accordingly!

# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Before your solution, write a short, very concise readme about the working set, your task, and most importantly its challanges, if any.


EXAMPLE START
```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 9 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
cat > x.js << 'EOF'
[...]
'EOF'
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
EXAMPLE END

Before starting, check if you need more files or info to solve the task.

If the task is not clear:

EXAMPLE START
I need more information to solve the task. [Description of the missing info]
EXAMPLE END

Do not edit files not provided in the working set!
If you need more files:

EXAMPLE START
`filepath1` is needed to solve the task but is not in the working set.
EXAMPLE END
