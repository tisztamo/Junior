  <MultiSelect> is for selecting items from an array. It contains three parts:
  List of the selected items on the top, search bar in the middle (!), and the
  filtered list of selectables on the bottom.
    - <ResultSet> and <FilteredList> are each a list of items, which comes as prop
    - <SearchBar> Is text input with placeholder "Enter space-separated search terms!" Keep the state in the model!
