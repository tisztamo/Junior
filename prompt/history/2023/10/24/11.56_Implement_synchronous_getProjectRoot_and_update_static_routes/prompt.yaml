requirements: >-
  Create src/backend/fileutils/getProjectRoot.js with a function which, when
  first called, goes up from import.meta in the file system to the first dir
  containing a package.json. If found, returns and memoizes it. If not, throws
  an error. Use this new function instead of the dot-dot based logic when
  setting up static routes.
