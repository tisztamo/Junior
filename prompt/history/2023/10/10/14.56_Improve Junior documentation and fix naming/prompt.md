*"Video: Junior codes itself"*

Junior is an **AI-first IDE** designed specifically for professional programmers who have a preference for customizing and fine-tuning their tools. 

With Junior, developers get a unique space where they can work hand-in-hand with AI throughout the development process. By using structured task descriptors and spotlighting relevant parts of a project, tasks like code implementation, documentation, and testing can be seamlessly delegated to Junior.

At its core, Junior embraces a design philosophy that prioritizes simplicity, configurability, and auditability. This ensures that the platform remains both accessible to its users and adaptable to a variety of use-cases.

Junior has been crafted exclusively with AI-powered coding right from its early days, way before its core functionalities were in place. This demonstrates Junior's pioneering approach to harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence in software development.

## Getting Started

For guidance on using Junior, please refer to [usage.md](usage.md).

## Contributing and Support

Your contributions make a difference! At Junior, we value the collaboration of the community. Your role as a contributor is to monitor the development, provide detailed prompts, and thoroughly review the generated outcomes.

For questions or assistance, please raise an issue in our GitHub repository.

**Note:** We've tested Junior primarily with the GPT-4 model. However, you're welcome to experiment with similarly capable models and share your findings. It's not compatible with GPT-3.5.

# Developing External Projects with Junior

## Installation

Install Junior as a development dependency by running the following command:

```
npm add @aijunior/dev --save-dev
```
Additionally, you can install the "Junior" vscode extension from the vscode extension marketplace.

## Initialization

You can initialize the necessary files in the repository with the command:

```
npx junior-init
```

This will create the following files:

```
.gitignore
prompt/projectSpecifics.md
prompt.yaml
```

The Task Interaction Files (TIF) will be gitignored:
  - `prompt.yaml`, the prompt descriptor filled by the user ([descriptor.md](./descriptor.md))
  - `prompt.md`, the generated prompt by Junior
  - `change.sh`, the changeset generated by the language model

### Project Specifics

`prompt/projectSpecifics.md` is used to provide instructions about the codebase that Junior is working on, like preferred tools. It is important to keep this file minimal as it will be included in most prompts, and unnecessary complexity may result in the language model losing track and failing to solve the task.

## Starting Junior

You can start Junior with:

```
npx junior-web
```

For more information about the web interface, please refer to [web.md](./web.md).

```

# Task

Improve the documentation!

Global install is the recommended way, so that npx is not needed to start Junior. The user has to run junior-web in the project they want to work on. Update the docs!
Also fix the naming issue: The paid ChatGPT is calles Plus, not Pro.

Do NOT create backup files.

# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Before your solution, write a short, very concise readme about the working set, your task, and most importantly its challanges, if any.


EXAMPLE START
```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 9 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
cat > x.js << 'EOF'
[...]
'EOF'
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
EXAMPLE END

Before starting, check if you need more files or info to solve the task.

If the task is not clear:

EXAMPLE START
I need more information to solve the task. [Description of the missing info]
EXAMPLE END

Do not edit files not provided in the working set!
If you need more files:

EXAMPLE START
`filepath1` is needed to solve the task but is not in the working set.
EXAMPLE END
