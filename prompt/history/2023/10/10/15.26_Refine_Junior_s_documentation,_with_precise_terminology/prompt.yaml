attention:
  - ./docs/web.md
requirements: >-
  - Fix the naming of ChatGPT Plus (not Pro)

  - Remove the architecture section

  - Rewrite the workflow section: Editing prompt.yaml directly is not needed
  anymore, remove. The current workflow is: Starting junior-web from the project
  dir, entering the requirements, selecting the attention files, generating the
  prompt, executing it with ChatGPT and pasting back the output for execution.
