  Call ansiToHtml on the last line before setting the signal, and inject it to
  the innerHtml to allow coloring. 


  FYI the docs says:


  #innerHTML/textContent

  These work the same as their property equivalent. Set a string and they will
  be set. Be careful!! Setting innerHTML with any data that could be exposed to
  an end user as it could be a vector for malicious attack. textContent while
  generally not needed is actually a performance optimization when you know the
  children will only be text as it bypasses the generic diffing routine.


  <div textContent={state.text} />
