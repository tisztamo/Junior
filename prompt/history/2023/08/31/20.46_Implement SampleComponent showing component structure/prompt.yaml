  We need a Sample Component, which is short but shows

  how we write our components.

  We need to show: - How the model is used - How local state is managed - How
  services are called - etc.

  Imagine a sample service and model, use it in the sample component, but do not
  write it.

  Write a comprehensive and concise sample to
  src/frontend/components/SampleComponent.jsx
