*"Video: Junior codes itself"*

Junior is an **AI-first IDE** designed specifically for professional programmers who have a preference for customizing and fine-tuning their tools. 

With Junior, developers get a unique space where they can work hand-in-hand with AI throughout the development process. By using structured task descriptors and spotlighting relevant parts of a project, tasks like code implementation, documentation, and testing can be seamlessly delegated to Junior.

At its core, Junior embraces a design philosophy that prioritizes simplicity, configurability, and auditability. This ensures that the platform remains both accessible to its users and adaptable to a variety of use-cases.

Junior has been crafted exclusively with AI-powered coding right from its early days, way before its core functionalities were in place. This demonstrates Junior's pioneering approach to harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence in software development.
