  handleRequirementsChange should be binded to change events

  and cleared: only the postDescriptor call is needed. Also remove the variables
  not needed anymore.

  For input events, create a new handler which
    - reads the prompt descriptor
    - parses as yaml
    - updates the requirements section
    - writes back to the descriptor as string
