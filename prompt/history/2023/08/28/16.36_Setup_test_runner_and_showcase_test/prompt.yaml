  We want to implement the following test:
    - Create file new_file.test
    - Append "You should not see this. Appended for Test at " + the filename of the test to package.json
    - Open the Junior frontend
    - Check if the new and modified filenames are in the DOM
    - Click the "Roll Back" button
    - Test if the new file got removed
    - Test if the appended text was removed from package.json
    - Test that the modified filenames are not in the DOM
  Do not implement it yet, only install the best test runner for this,
  and create a showcase test which opens the frontend and checks if it starts.
