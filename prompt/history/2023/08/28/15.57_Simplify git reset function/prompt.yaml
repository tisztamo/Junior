  The current git reset method tries to retain the prompt files.

  But we recently gitignored them so no need to handle them anymore.


  resetGit should do the following:

  - Delete every new files and dirs that are not gitignored

  - Undo every modifications since the last commit

  - And nothing else. Maybe the stash creation and dropping is also not needed
  anymore:
