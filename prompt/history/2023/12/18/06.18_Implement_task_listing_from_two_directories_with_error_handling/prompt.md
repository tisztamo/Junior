# Task

Implement the following feature!

- Create a plan!
- Create new files when needed!

Requirements:

When listing tasks, first load them from &#34;prompt/task&#34; relative to the current directory (ignore errors here, use empty list on error, no log), then concatenate the ones loaded with the current method from &#34;prompt/task&#34; relative to the project root (allow errors to escape from here).
The returned paths should be relative to the root used (cwd or project root). Note that this is not an async fn, do not change this.


## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function or signal*! eg.: in createGitRepo.js: export function createGitRepo ( ....
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs* and Tailwind, edit .jsx files accordingly!

Write concise, self-documenting and idiomatic ES6 code!

# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Avoid using sed. Always heredoc full files.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Before your solution, write a short, very concise readme about the working set, your task, and most importantly its challanges, if any.


EXAMPLE START
```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 9 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"

# Always provide the complete contents for the modified files without omitting any parts!
cat > x.js << EOF
  let i = 1
  console.log(\`i: \${i}\`)
EOF
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
EXAMPLE END

Before starting, check if you need more files or info to solve the task.

If the task is not clear:

EXAMPLE START
I need more information to solve the task. [Description of the missing info]
EXAMPLE END

Do not edit files not provided in the working set!
If you need more files:

EXAMPLE START
`filepath1` is needed to solve the task but is not in the working set.
EXAMPLE END

# Working set

src/backend/handlers/listTasks.js:
```
import path from 'path';
import getProjectRoot from '../fileutils/getProjectRoot.js';
import { readDirRecursively } from '../fileutils/readDirRecursively.js';

export const listTasks = () => {
    const projectRoot = getProjectRoot();
    const tasksDir = path.join(projectRoot, 'prompt/task');
    return readDirRecursively(tasksDir).map(file => path.relative(tasksDir, file));
};

```
