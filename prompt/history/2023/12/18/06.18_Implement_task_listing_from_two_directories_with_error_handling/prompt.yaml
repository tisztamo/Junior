requirements: >-
  When listing tasks, first load them from "prompt/task" relative to the current
  directory (ignore errors here, use empty list on error, no log), then
  concatenate the ones loaded with the current method from "prompt/task"
  relative to the project root (allow errors to escape from here).

  The returned paths should be relative to the root used (cwd or project root).
  Note that this is not an async fn, do not change this.
