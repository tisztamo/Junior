  The install script fails to decide correctly if it runs directly or not
  because differences in paths:


  file:///C:/work/tmp/Junior/scripts/installBashIfWindows.js vs
  file://C:\work\tmp\Junior\scripts\installBashIfWindows.js


  Remove this check, the file should only export the fn, not run it. Instead,
  move it to a newly created scripts/postinstall/ dir and import it from the
  postinstall script. Also update package.json accordingly.
