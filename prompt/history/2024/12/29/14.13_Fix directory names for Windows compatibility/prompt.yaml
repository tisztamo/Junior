  Instead of a colon, use dot character between hours and minutes in the
  directory name.


  Also create scripts/fixPromptPathsForWindows.js which runs through the dir
  prompt/history recursively and renames all the directories that contain a
  colon in the name. The script will run on unix, to fix the directory structure
  and allow checkout on windows.


  Also tun the newly created script at the end.


  updateConfigList is an example script.
