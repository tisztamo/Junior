Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files using 'EOF' to prevent substitution.

OS: <%= os %>

Installed tools: <%= installedTools %>

Do NOT write any text outside the script!
